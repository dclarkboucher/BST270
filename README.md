Welcome to my GitHub repository for BST 270 - Reproducible Data Science, a 
biostatistics course taught by Dr. Viola Fanfani in the Harvard TH Chan
School of Public Health. This repository contains all the files needed to 
read, understand, and reproduce my final project. 

To read my final project, open the file "project_writeup.html", which should open
in your browser. To execute the code needed to produce that document, open the
file "BST270.Rproj", which should open an RStudio session that is automatically
linked to the project directory; then open "project_writeup.Rmd", the RMarkdown
file containing my code. A few helper scripts can be found in the subfolder
"helper_scripts", but you do not need to run these manually, as they will be 
called automatically by the RMarkdown. 

If you are interested in reading the instructions for the project, see
the Rmarkdown file and html file located in the "project_instructions" subfolder. 
If you are interested in examining the New Times figures that I reference, see
the "original_figures" subfolder. 

Last, if you have other questions, feel free to email me at 
<dclarkboucher@g.harvard.edu>.
